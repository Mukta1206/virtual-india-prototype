<br>
  <p>This project was independently designed and developed by Mukta Tanksale as a full-stack web prototype to explore how technology, data, and intelligent systems can come together to create meaningful digital experiences.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the end-to-end development process from concept and system design to implementation while experimenting with modern web development practices, modular architecture, and API-driven features. It reflects a hands-on approach to learning, problem solving, and building real world applications.
At its current stage, this platform is a working prototype. Certain features and integrations are intentionally incomplete or simplified, as the focus is on validating ideas, architecture, and user interaction rather than delivering a fully production ready system. The project is designed to evolve over time, with scope for performance improvements, UI enhancements, and additional functionality.
This prototype represents both a technical and creative exploration, highlighting curiosity, adaptability, and the ability to translate ideas into tangible digital products.
